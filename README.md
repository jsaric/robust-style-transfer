# Neural Style Transfer
Seminar work on neural style transfer for Digital Image Analysis course at the
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.

## Paper
You can read the manuscript [here](paper.pdf).

## Code
You can also reproduce the results using [the notebook](style_transfer.ipynb).

## Thanks
Parts of this code are based on the original implementation [github](https://github.com/leongatys/PytorchNeuralStyleTransfer).
Some of the style images are taken from [github](https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN).
